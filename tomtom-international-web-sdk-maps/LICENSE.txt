Your agreement with TomTom includes the following terms and conditions and the Privacy Policy ( https://www.tomtom.com/en_gb/privacy/ ). You should not use the Web SDK if you cannot agree to this Agreement and the Privacy Policy.

You may not use the Web SDK and may not accept the Agreement if you are a person barred from receiving the Web SDK under the laws of the United States or other countries, including the country in which you are resident or from which you use the Web SDK. If you agree to be bound by the Agreement on behalf of your employer or other entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to bind your employer or such entity to the Agreement.

GRANT OF LICENSE: Subject to and conditional upon your compliance at all times with this Agreement, TomTom grants to you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable and non-sublicensable, revocable, royalty-free license during the Term (as defined in Clause 9) to use the Web SDK in connection with the development of web based applications to be used in connection with the TomTom Maps APIs and, in addition, third party online APIs (“Permitted Applications”). For the avoidance of doubt, you must use the TomTom Maps APIs in connection with the Web SDK. Any such Permitted Application and use of the TomTom Maps APIs shall be subject to TomTom’s standard terms of use applicable to the TomTom Maps APIs as made available on the TomTom developer portal or any other specific written agreement that you and TomTom have executed regarding the use of the TomTom Maps APIs.

2.

3.5. The Web SDK may include data which TomTom licenses from third parties or open source software. You shall comply with all requirements and restrictions which such third parties may require TomTom to impose on you (and as may be updated and amended by TomTom from time to time). All applicable OSS Licenses are included within the Web SDK download package. It shall be your responsibility to check, review and comply with any updated or amended terms that would apply to the Web SDK licensed to you under this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, any such software is made available to you under the terms and conditions of the applicable licenses.

    Copyright 2018 The Noto Project Authors (github.com/googlei18n/noto-fonts)

    This Font Software is licensed under the SIL Open Font License,
    Version 1.1.

    This license is copied below, and is also available with a FAQ at:

    -----------------------------------------------------------
    SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
    -----------------------------------------------------------

    PREAMBLE
    The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
    development of collaborative font projects, to support the font
    creation efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to
    provide a free and open framework in which fonts may be shared and
    improved in partnership with others.

    The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
    redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
    fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
    redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
    names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
    however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
    requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply to
    any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

    DEFINITIONS
    "Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
    Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
    include source files, build scripts and documentation.

    "Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
    copyright statement(s).

    "Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software
    components as distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).

    "Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to,
    deleting, or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the
    components of the Original Version, by changing formats or by porting
    the Font Software to a new environment.

    "Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
    writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.

    PERMISSION & CONDITIONS
    Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining
    a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed,
    modify, redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the
    Font Software, subject to the following conditions:

    1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components, in
    Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.

    2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
    redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy
    contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be
    included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or
    in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or
    binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.

    3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
    Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the
    corresponding Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the
    primary font name as presented to the users.

    4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font
    Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
    Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the
    Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written
    permission.

    5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,
    must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be
    distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to
    remain under this license does not apply to any document created using
    the Font Software.

    TERMINATION
    This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are
    not met.

    DISCLAIMER
    THE FONT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
    EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF
